Oral rehabilitation with dental implant born prostheses is a safe and predictable intervention following tooth loss.  Assessment of bone quality of the implant recipient site prior to or during dental implant placement is paramount for the surgeon, because it influences the long term success of the implants. Histological and microarchitectural analasys of bone core biopsy samples harvested from the implant recipient site is an adequate method to assess bone quality. Concurrently with dental implant surgeries there is an opportunity to monitor the bone micro-architecture and histological properties by virtue of bone biopsy sampling following bone augmentation procedures. The gold standard of bone micro-architectural examinations is histomorphometry, which relies on two-dimensional sections to deduce the spatial properties of the structures.\cite{iwaniec,bernhardt,Bouxsein:2010}  The goal of this study is to present a methodology to create 3 dimensional structures reconstructed from high resolution histological sections by utilizing convolutional neural networks to annotate the images, discard the folded and/or torn section with an unsupervised information-theory-based clustering algorithm and apply Homography to correct perspective of each image. The resulting models then can be used for 3 dimensional micromorphometry analysis to aid the decision making process of medical professionals.
